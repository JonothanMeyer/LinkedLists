This program provides the basic structure for several types of linked lists. These include singly linked lists (head reference, non-circular)
with int inputs, doubly linked lists (head/tail references, non-circular) with double inputs, and circular singly linked lists with string
inputs. Each list contains various functionality such as building a list, printing in reverse, inserting at head/tail/position, check
sorting, list size, check duplication, find min/max values in list, find sum/average, and others. All relevant code is located in the
scr file. Follow prompts within the console after running the driver to use this program.

3: Add a double to its proper place in an ordered list
4: Delete head node
5: Delete tail node
6: Print in reverse
7: Find sum and average of list
8: Print list
9: Check size of list

SingleL: Singly Linked List. Input of Integers

2: Insert at end         
3: Print all Strings of size less than user-input length
